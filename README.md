# Tic-Tac-Toe

## About the project

The project is designed by [JetBrains Academy](https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/) and realised as a part of [Java Developer track](https://hyperskill.org/onboarding) using [EduTools](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10081-edutools) plugin for [IDEA InteliJ IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

Simulation of a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game. After the program's startup the empty 3x3 game field is printed to the console and the user (player "X") is asked for entering the coordinates of his/hers move. The given coordinates are being validated and if they are fine, the user's move is marked on the game field. Then the same procedure is being executed with the "O" player. The game stops when one of the players has 3 marks in a row or there is a mark combination resulting in a tie.

[Detailed description](https://hyperskill.org/projects/48) of the project is available on JetBrains Academy website.

### Realisation of the project was divided into 5 stages:
- Stage #1. Printing empty game field to the console.
- Stage #2. Taking user input to print the field.
- Stage #3. Validating user input and analyzing the game result.
- Stage #4. Outputting the game field with user's move.
- Stage #5. Add "X" and "O" player option and determine the game result.

### Main topics covered by this project
- multi-dimensional arrays
- input validation and processing
- loops and conditions
- defining methods
